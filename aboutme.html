    <p id="introduction">My name is Rizky Amanatama.<br />
        I am a 2nd-year student at Bina Nusantara University. I major in Game Application and Technology. I started tp love coding in senior high, but I never get a chance to tried it. After graduate from senior high, my parents told me to go to STAN instead of BINUS. I love coding so I force my parents to let me go to BINUS and prove myself that I can do more than what they said. After a year in BINUS, I lost my interest in game development a bit because we only learn a little and its not what I expected. That's why I don't know what to do anymore. After a few months, I decided to build a basic Discord bot for my server called LOR. I tried it and it works. After that, it got me into a different world. Back in the days, I was interested in Software Engineering. Right now, I'm focusing myself to be a Software Engineering. I am studying IOS Development right now and pursue my dream right now to be an IOS Engineering. I will do whatever it takes to pursue my dream and hold my promise to myself.
