    <p id="introduction">My name is Rizky Amanatama.<br />
            I am a 2nd year student in Bina Nusantara University. I major in Game Application and Technology. I started tp love coding in senior high, but i never get a change to tried it. After graduate from senior high, my parents told me to go to STAN instead of BINUS. I love coding so i force my parents to let me go to BINUS and prove myself that i can do more than what they said. After a year in BINUS, i lost my interest in game development a bit because we only learn a little and its not what i expected. That's why i don't know what to do anymore. After a few months, i decided to build a basic Discord bot for my server called LOR. I tried it and it works. After that it got me into a different world. Back in the days i was interest in Software Engineering. Right now, i'm focusing myself to be a Software Engineering. I am studying IOS Development right now and pursue my dream right now to be a IOS Engineering. I will do whatever it takes to pursue my dream and hold my promise to myself.
